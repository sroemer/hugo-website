Hi, I am Stefan Römer aka. RustyRoman.

{{< image src="/img/avatar.png" alt="Stefan Römer aka. RustyRoman" position="center" style="border-style: solid; bolder-size: 8px; border-color: grey; border-radius: 50%;" >}}


I am a Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of working experience (mainly C/C++, shell and batch
scripts, python) and in-depth OS (Windows and Linux) and networking knowledge.

Initially I got interested in computers when my father bought an IBM compatible 286AT with MS DOS 3.3
a long time ago. With the time I used different Windows versions (from Windows 3.1 to the current versions)
but since I got my hands on a bundle of SuSE Linux 5.1 at the local book store I am a Linux fan (currently
running Artix Linux).

Recently I got interested in cyber security and started gaining knowledge on the
[TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) platform. Here my TryHackMe badge: {{< thm_badge >}}

I live in Vietnam and also like photography and playing badminton.
