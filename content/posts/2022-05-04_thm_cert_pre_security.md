After joining the TryHackMe platform I just finished a first learning path ('Pre Security').

Contents:

This learning path will teach you the pre-requisite technical knowledge to get started in cyber security.
To attack or defend any technology, you have to first learn how this technology works.

The Pre-Security learning path is a beginner friendly and fun way to learn the basics. Your cyber security learning journey starts here!
